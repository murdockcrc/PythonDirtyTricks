# Python tricks
Personal notes from cool but easy-to-forget Python syntax

# Setup
This project is designed to be used with conda. For that purpose, there is an `environment.yml` file provided for you

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a conda environment named `tricks`

Running this command will create a conda environment with all needed dependencies, fixed to Python 3.8.x
